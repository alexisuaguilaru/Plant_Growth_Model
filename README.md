## Introduction
Understanding and being able to predict when plant growth is significant becomes an important task for industrial agriculture, since this leads to an optimization of resources (time, materials and human resources) that results in higher profits and lower losses for the farmer.

## General Aim
The purpose of this work is to present a classification model capable of determining whether a plant will have significant growth based on environmental and management factors.

## About the Dataset
The data set was taken [[1]](#references). It contains the measurements such as the amount of sunlight hours, temperature and humidity, as well as those concerning soil type, irrigation frequency, type of fertilizer and whether there was a significant growth
